# 👋 Hi, I'm Ernesto Rodriguez

I'm a web development student at triOS College, currently focused on front-end development. I'm building real-world skills through hands-on projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, version control, and UI/UX design principles. My short-term goal is to become a front-end developer and land my first job in the tech industry.

## 👨‍🎨 A Little About Me

Beyond tech, I also teach classical drawing and painting in the tradition of 19th-century French academies. I’ve worked as a bartender and a travel agent—so I understand the value of communication, hospitality, and creating memorable user experiences (online and offline).
